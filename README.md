# Java - Skyline Problem

This is a project done for my Data Structures class and uploaded at a later date.

In this problem, a skyline is defined as the silhouette of all the buildings in a city. The problem is then, when you are given the width and height of all the buildings, to create the skyline. Buildings are represented as a tuple of three values: (left, height, right), where left is the left point of the building, height is the building's height, and right is the right point of the building.

In this project, two solutions tot his problem are given. First is by an induction algorithm and second is through a divide and conquer algorithm.
